    "# Sampling deals\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you counted the deals Amir worked on. Now it's time to randomly pick five deals so that you can reach out to each customer and ask if they were satisfied with the service they received. You'll try doing this both with and without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, you want to make sure this is done randomly and that it can be reproduced in case you get asked how you chose the deals, so you'll need to set the random seed before sampling from the deals.\n",

    "Both pandas as pd and numpy as np are loaded and amir_deals is available."
